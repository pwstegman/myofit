# In the following example, we construct a NeighborsClassifier class from an array representing our data set and ask whoâ€™s the closest point to [1,1,1]
# >>>
# >>> samples = [[0., 0., 0.], [0., .5, 0.], [1., 1., .5]]
# >>> from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors
# >>> neigh = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=1)
# >>> neigh.fit(samples) 
# NearestNeighbors(algorithm='auto', leaf_size=30, ...)
# >>> print(neigh.kneighbors([1., 1., 1.])) 
# (array([[ 0.5]]), array([[2]]...))
# As you can see, it returns [[0.5]], and [[2]], which means that the element is at distance 0.5 and is the third element of samples (indexes start at 0).
